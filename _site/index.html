<h2><a href="/macro-systems.html">Macro systems in Scheme</a></h2>
<p>There are several issues that macro systems in Scheme address, and different kinds of solutions to these. Here are a set of mostly orthogonal concepts that any macro system has to relate to: (I don’t describe each concept in detail as that would take too much text to make this list useful as an overview)</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A macro system can allow or disallow execution of arbitrary Scheme code at macro expansion time. Disallowing it (like for instance syntax-rules does) works around a whole haze of problems, mostly related to separation of expansion-time and run-time environments. On the other hand, allowing it adds significant power and adds lots of exciting possibilities. Even though syntax-rules is a turing complete system, it’s not as powerful as a typical system that allows execution of arbitrary Scheme code at expansion time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A macro system can be fully unhygienic (as define-macro in Gambit-C), fully hygienic (as syntax-rules is), or allow partial unhygiene (like syntactic closures, explicit renaming and syntax-case). When allowing partial unhygiene, most systems work by either makeing hygiene explicit (like explicit renaming) or by making unhygiene explicit (like syntax-case).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A macro system can be based on pattern matching (syntax-rules) and/or explicit destructuring of the input form (explicit renaming). You can always implement a mechanism for pattern matching on a system based on explicit destructuring. The reverse can be true, but it is not always possible (syntax-rules is an example).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A macro system can be designed so that macros’ output are plain s-expressions (Gambit-C’s define-macro), special “syntax” objects (syntax-case), or a hybrid (syntactic closures). Letting the output be plain s-expressions feels very natural and is easy to understand conceptually. Output can be constructed using quasiquotation. In this respect, the hybrid approach works more or less like plain s-expressions. Having special “syntax” objects does in my opinion add significant conceptual overhead. It does, however, also enable other very important features, the most important being that the syntax objects can contain source code location. Plain s-expressions based on lists and symbols can’t do that.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A macro system might or might not allow macros to preserve source code location. I know of three major approaches to this problem: 1) Gambit-C’s define-macro, explicit renaming and syntactic closures do not allow macros to preserve source code location. 2) Gambit has an internal style of macros ##define-syntax that gets the Gambit compiler’s internal representation of source code with location annotations. Macros written in this style must explicitly make sure to annotate the source code with location 3) syntax-rules and syntax-case macros can be implemented so that source code location is preserved automatically and implicitly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Another important aspect of macro systems is that they might or might not provide useful tools for useful syntax error reporting. Explicit destructuring of the input form usually results in either useless errors (like cdr on a non-pair error) or lots of error handling code that needs to be written for every macro. Pattern matching is a big gain here; it makes it possible for the macro system to provide at least somewhat useful errors. syntax-case provides some good tools for this, but I think this could be made even better.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A macro system can play more or less well with others. For instance, syntax-rules can coexist with pretty much any other hygienic system. It’s often not very difficult to make non-hygienic systems play well with each other. Explicit renaming and syntactic closures seem to work well together. I don’t know of any way that works well to combine pure Gambit-C define-macro with any kind of hygienic system. syntax-case is quite exclusive since it restricts macros to be procedures of one argument, which is exactly the format that syntax-case destructures.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An implementation of macros can restrict itself to one single type of macros, for instance syntax-rules (many simpler R5RS implementations), syntax-case (most (all?) R6RS implementations) or Gambit-C’s define-macro (Gambit-C 4). Some macro systems are powerful enough to implement other macro system on them, syntax-rules can for instance be implemented in terms of syntax-case or syntactic closures. Explicit renaming can be implemented in terms of syntactic closures (and possibly also the other way around but I’m not sure). Some are not. For instance, it’s not possible to implement syntax-rules in terms of Gambit-C define-macro or vice versa.</p>

<p>Or, a macro system implementation can choose to use some algorithm internally that is powerful enough to implement several macro systems and expose interfaces to them separately. This is sometimes useful, but not very often, because many algorithms are so tightly knit to the system that it implements that it can’t do any other thing; to the extent it’s possible other macro systems can just as easily be implemented above the macro expansion algorithm layer. For instance, there’s no reason to implement an algorithm that can do both syntax-case and syntax-rules, because syntax-rules is trivial to implement with only syntax-case. And the common (only?) algorithm for implementing syntax-case can’t be used to implement syntactic closures. These are some of the most important design decisions that can be made when designing a macro system. In practise, it’s a trade-off between ease of use, ease of understanding, and power (and power can be measured in several different ways). I wish that there was a macro system that is hygienic, automatically preserves source code location information, allows execution of arbitrary Scheme code, is extensible and is easy to understand. But so far, no one seems to have succeeded to do this. I would love to be able to write macros in Common Lisp-style, using quasiquote or similar, with powerful but optional pattern matching tools.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>So us Schemers have to live with compromises, having to learn several macro systems or one highly complex one. syntax-rules is great for simple macros but it doesn’t work very well for complex macros. Syntactic closures is good, but it’s not always easy to avoid hygiene mistakes. syntax-case is good, but it IMO adds many non-Schemey concepts; one of my main gripes with it is that it introduces a new concept of pattern variable bindings which are distinct from macros and normal variable (“lambda”) bindings. To me that is a significant step back from Scheme’s simplicity. Maybe I’ll just have to live with that.</p>
